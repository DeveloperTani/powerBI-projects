# 📊 Power BI Projects

This repository contains a collection of data visualization projects built using **Power BI**. Each project explores a specific dataset and presents insights through interactive dashboards, backed by light data processing where needed (e.g., Python scripts, Azure pipelines).

> 🎯 These are practical, insight-focused dashboards designed to demonstrate real-world skills in data modeling, visualization, and communication.
